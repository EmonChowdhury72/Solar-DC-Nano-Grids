Mission

To provide reliable, affordable, and clean electricity for small vendors and micro-entrepreneurs in Bangladesh by reducing dependence on unreliable grid power and costly diesel generators through modular Solar-DC nano-grid systems.

Vision

To build a scalable, data-driven Solar-DC Nano-Grid model that can be locally assembled, easily maintained, and replicated across urban and peri-urban markets in Bangladesh and South Asia—supporting sustainable livelihoods and clean energy access.

General Project Information

SolarSpark Bangladesh is developing a DC-only solar energy solution optimized for small businesses affected by frequent load-shedding. The system integrates solar generation, MPPT-based charging, lithium-ion battery storage, regulated DC output, and real-time monitoring to ensure efficiency, reliability, and long-term system health.

The solution is designed to be:

Low-cost and modular

Easy to scale and repair

Suitable for informal and small-scale users

Environmentally sustainable

Competition Status

This project is being developed as part of an ongoing competition under the Sustainable Energy theme.

✅ We are currently in Phase 2 (Prototype & Validation Phase).
A functional hardware MVP has been built, tested, and iterated, demonstrating stable Solar-DC power delivery with real-time monitoring. The project is now prepared for pilot deployment and further scaling.
