## MVP (Minimum Viable Product) & Future Plan

### MVP Development

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was developed to validate the core functionality of the Solar-DC Nano-Grid system—from energy generation to storage, regulation, and monitoring.

**Key components and requirements used to build the MVP:**
- Solar panels (bench-scale) for renewable energy generation  
- MPPT charge controller for efficient and safe battery charging  
- Lithium-ion (18650) battery pack for energy storage and backup power  
- Boost converter to provide stable regulated DC output  
- ESP32 microcontroller for data collection and system control  
- Dual INA219 current and voltage sensors to monitor:
  - Solar generation (input side)
  - Load consumption (output side)
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor to observe environmental impact on performance  
- On-device display module for real-time debugging and status monitoring  
- Basic wiring, protection components, and enclosure  

**What the MVP demonstrates:**
- End-to-end Solar-DC energy flow (solar → battery → load)  
- Improved energy harvesting through MPPT charging  
- Stable DC output under variable battery voltage and load conditions  
- Real-time measurement of power generation versus consumption  
- System feasibility, safety, and monitoring accuracy

### Future Plan

#### Short-Term Plan (Next 3–6 Months)
- Upgrade MVP capacity for higher power output  
- Build 3–5 pilot units for real-world testing  
- Integrate basic cloud logging and dashboard visualization  
- Deploy pilot systems with selected vendors  
- Collect performance data and user feedback for refinement  

#### Long-Term Plan (1–3 Years)
- Standardize the Solar-DC Nano-Grid as a modular kit  
- Enable local assembly, repair, and maintenance networks  
- Partner with NGOs, city councils, and microfinance institutions  
- Scale deployment market-wise and city-wise  
- Introduce financing options such as pay-as-you-go or microcredit models  

The long-term objective is to deliver a **scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy solution** that supports small businesses, reduces carbon emissions, and strengthens local economic resilience.
