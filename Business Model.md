## 💰 Revenue & Sustainability Approach
To ensure financial viability and ease of adoption, the project explores multiple sustainable approaches:

1.  **Direct System Sales:** Sales directly to established vendors and small businesses.
2.  **Strategic Partnerships:** Collaboration with NGOs, city councils, and market associations for bulk deployment.
3.  **Microfinance Models:** Ownership models backed by microfinance institutions to ease upfront payment.
4.  **Flexible Payments:** Implementation of Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) or installment-based payment options.

*These approaches effectively reduce adoption barriers while ensuring the long-term viability of the system.*

## 📈 Scalability & Growth Strategy
Our model supports rapid scaling through a replication-based strategy rather than redesigning for every new market:

* **📦 Standardized Modular Kits:** Ready-to-deploy units for quick installation.
* **🚢 Bulk Component Sourcing:** Procuring parts in bulk to significantly reduce unit costs.
* **🔧 Local Technician Networks:** Building a network for decentralized assembly and repair.
* **city-wise Deployment:** Systematic expansion market-by-market and city-by-city.
